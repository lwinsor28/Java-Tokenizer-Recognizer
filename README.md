# Java-Tokenizer-Recognizer

# Description

This project implements a Tokenizer and Recognizer designed to analyze and validate strings based on a user-defined context-free grammar. The Tokenizer processes input strings into tokens, and the Recognizer validates whether the tokenized input adheres to the specified grammar.

Developed as part of a Programming Languages course, the project demonstrates proficiency in theoretical concepts such as grammars and syntax analysis, as well as practical skills in software development.

# Features

- Custom Grammar Parsing: Allows users to define grammars with rules specifying valid syntax structures.
- Tokenization: Splits input strings into tokens for easier processing.
- Input Validation: Verifies that the tokenized input complies with the provided grammar.
- Error Handling: Detects and reports invalid tokens or syntax errors.
